# Mr.Hopper-s-goal
Exciting news! I've been working on a new game called "Mr. Hopper's Goal" using JavaScript and the ProcessingJS library. This game is a fun and challenging platformer where players control a creature named Mr. Hopper as he jumps through levels to reach his ultimate goal.

The ultimate goal of Mr.Hopper is to buy the Great fort which is mentioned in the game. In order to buy that Great fort, Mr.Hopper has to gain $130. There will be some coins in the highway road and the user has to help Mr.Hopper to grab that coin and to buy that Great Fort.

Using JavaScript and ProcessingJS, I was able to create a visually stunning and interactive game that runs smoothly. The library's easy-to-use syntax made it a breeze to create complex animations and game mechanics that keep players engaged and entertained.

Note : As this game is developed in the Protected Environment on Khan Academy ( the game is developed inside text editor of the khan academy which has inbuilt support of processing JS), currently this game doesn't work on the local browser. I am continuously working on navigating this project to the condition where it work on any browser without any external supports and modules. In order to enjoy this game, run this project inside the text editor of Khan Academy. I also leave the original project link of Khan Academy here.

I'm really proud of what I've been able to accomplish with "Mr. Hopper's Goal" and can't wait to share it with the world. Stay tuned for more updates. #javascript #processingjs #gamedev #indiedev #MrHoppersGoal

# Development:
  I learnt JavaScript in Khan Academy and eventually developed this project as the result of my learning. I took nearly 1 week for the development of this game. I developed this game on June-July of 2021 before I came to college. So the source code may not be satisfy the Common rule of developes called DRY ( Don't Repeat Yourself). Instead I typed a lot and it follows the condition called WET ( We Enjoy Typing). I am working on optimising the source code and once it done, I will update here as the second version. It's been 2 years since I developed the game. Now I am going to work on optimising the source code.
